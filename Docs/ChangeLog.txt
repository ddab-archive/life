v5.2 of 29 November 2015
Released 29 November 2015

  - Removed main menu and customisable button bar. Replaced them with a single, non-customisable, toolbar with new glyphs.
  - Removed option to hide status bar.
  - Removed pop-up menu from game grid.

  - Application title removed from dialogue boxes.
  - Program exit confirmation dialogue box now prompts to save current game.
+ Program now writes its config data to the per-user application data directory when installed in Program Files or Common Files directories, fixing the problem of attempting to write to a write-protected directory. It continues to write config data to its install directory when installed elsewhere, so it can be used as a portable application.
